# SelfStudy
I am creating lessons around the material I am learning in Math and Stats, so that I can cement new information.

Currently I have begun doing small 'case studies' implementing the analytical techniques and lessons learned in khan academy stats lessons. Throughout the course of my updates I'll develop better file organization, as well as a more defined direction for the entire repository.

# To-Do's
- Unit 2 of Khan Stats
- Begin unit 1 of Khan Linear Algebra
    - Use Manim or some other library that is good for visualizing LA
- Delete the old 'Unit 1' folder from repo and local storage
