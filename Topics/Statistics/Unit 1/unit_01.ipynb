For instance, sorting `Gender` by any method in particular (e.g., alphabetical, or other) is arbitrary, and would not imply that `Female` is associated with a greater amount or larger value than `Male`, should `Female` appear before `Male` in a list. *Ordinal Variables*, on the other hand, do have an intrinsic ordering to them. When looking at the `Engagement Metrics` column, we see that there is a distinct set of three values: `Medium, Low, High`. If that list felt odd to read in that order, that is because there is an associated relative value with each of these variables, where `Low` is considered to be less than `Medium`, and `Medium` is considered to be less than `High`, so the list, when sorted, should not be sorted alphabetically, but by their relative values: `Low, Medium, High`."

    "Like *Categorical Variables*, *Numerical Variables* can come in two flavors: *Discrete* and *Continuous*. When is comes to distinguishing these two subtypes, the general rule of thumb centers around the \"countability\" and \"divisibility\" of the data in the set. For instance, `Customer Support Interactions` is comprised of integers that range from 0-10. Additionally, an interaction cannot be divided into smaller parts, as you either had one interaction or haven't had a particular interaction. `Feedback/Ratings`, depending on how it is derived, could be either a *Discrete* or *Continuous Variable*. If this column represents a singular rating, that would imply users could select from among 50 distinct floating point numbers between 1.0-5.0 (or 60 distinct floating point numbers if options ranged from 0.0-5.0). In this scenario, the possible set of values is both countable and indivisible, and therefore would be a *Discrete Variable*. However, if this column represents the average rating of `Customer Support Interactions`, then it would be *Continuous Variable*, as the set of values prior to rounding to the tenths place, are infinite (think three rating with a total score of 4, that would be an average rating of 1.3 repeating)."

This can also be seen by the inclusion of the date columns, because pandas stores them as datetime objects. The specific data type for dates can differ in how they're used. In some ways the can be a *nominal variable* if we're interested in counting the number of occurences of each, an *ordinal variable* if we want to maintain its intrinsic order, a *continuous variable* if we care about the specific time of day something occurred (i.e., including the hours, minutes, seconds, ms, etc.), or an interval variable - not discussed in the Khan Academy lessons, so we will irgnore for now."
